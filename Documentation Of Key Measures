Formula: Revenue = SUM(fact_bookings[revenue_realized])
Table: fact_bookings

Formula: Total Bookings = COUNT(fact_bookings[booking_id])
Table: fact_bookings

Purpose: To get the total capacity of rooms present in hotels.
Formula: Total Capacity = SUM(fact_aggregated_bookings[capacity])
Table: fact_aggregated_bookings

4. Total Successful Bookings
Purpose: To get the total successful bookings that happened for all hotels.
Formula: Total Successful Bookings = SUM(fact_aggregated_bookings[successful_bookings])

8. Total Cancelled Bookings
Purpose: To get the count of "Cancelled" bookings out of all total bookings that happened.
Formula: Total Cancelled Bookings = CALCULATE([Total Bookings], fact_bookings[booking_status] = "Cancelled")

Formula: Cancellation % = DIVIDE([Total Cancelled Bookings], [Total Bookings])
Table: fact_bookings

11. Total No Show Bookings
Purpose: To get the count of "No Show" bookings out of all total bookings that happened (No Show means customers who neither cancelled nor attended to their booked rooms).
Formula: Total No Show Bookings = CALCULATE([Total Bookings], fact_bookings[booking_status] = "No Show")
Table: fact_bookings

12. No Show Rate %
Purpose: To calculate the no-show percentage.
Formula: No Show Rate % = DIVIDE([Total No Show Bookings], [Total Bookings])
Table: fact_bookings

13. Booking % by Platform
Purpose: To show the percentage contribution of each booking platform for bookings in hotels.
Formula: "Booking % by Platform = DIVIDE([Total Bookings], CALCULATE([Total Bookings], ALL(fact_bookings[booking_platform]))) * 100"
Table: fact_bookings

14. Booking % by Room Class
Purpose: To show the percentage contribution of each room class over the total rooms booked.

Table: fact_bookings, dim_rooms

15. ADR (Average Daily Rate)
Purpose: To calculate the ADR, which is the ratio of revenue to the total rooms booked/sold. It is the measure of the average paid for rooms sold in a given time period.
Formula: ADR = DIVIDE([Revenue], [Total Bookings], 0)
Table: fact_bookings

16. Realisation %
Purpose: To calculate the realisation percentage, which is the successful "Checked Out" percentage over all bookings that happened.
Formula: Realisation % = 1 - ([Cancellation %] + [No Show Rate %])
Table: fact_bookings

17. RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)
Purpose: To calculate the RevPAR, which represents the revenue generated per available room, whether or not they are occupied. RevPAR helps hotels measure their revenue-generating performance to accurately price rooms. RevPAR can help hotels measure themselves against other properties or brands.
Formula: RevPAR = DIVIDE([Revenue], [Total Capacity])
Tables: fact_bookings, fact_agg_bookings

19. DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights)
Purpose: To calculate DSRN, which tells on average how many rooms are ready to sell for a day considering a time period.
Formula: DSRN = DIVIDE([Total Capacity], [Number of Days])
Tables: fact_agg_bookings, dim_date

20. DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights)
Purpose: To calculate DURN, which tells on average how many rooms are successfully utilized by customers for a day considering a time period.
Formula: DURN = DIVIDE([Total Checked Out], [Number of Days])
Tables: fact_bookings, dim_date
