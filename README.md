Background:
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.
Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

A comprehensive dashboard was constructed, adhering to stakeholder mock-ups. The design ensures seamless alignment with metrics and prioritizes user-friendliness for effective decision-making.

Insights Generation:

Beyond the provided metrics and dashboard, additional insights were uncovered. These insights go beyond routine observations, offering valuable perspectives for strategic decision-making.
